Whether you're looking for the perfect abstract background, a cityscape to lose yourself in, a glimpse into digital art, or serene landscapes, our collection has something for everyone.

## Categories

Each category folder contains a selection of high-quality images, ensuring you'll find the perfect wallpaper to suit your mood or aesthetic preferences.

## Script Description

Included in this repository is a Python script, `walls-rename.py`, designed to streamline the process of renaming files within each category for easier navigation and consistency. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Functionality**: The script automatically renames all image files in each category directory, appending the category name followed by a sequential number for easy identification.
- **Skipping Directories and Files**: It intelligently skips over the `.git` directory and the `.DS_Store` files to avoid disrupting repository metadata or system-specific files.
- **Usage**: Simply run the script from the root of the repository, and it will process each category directory in turn.

## How to Use the Script

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Add your own pictures to this repository on your local machine.
3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
4. Navigate to the repository's root directory in your terminal.

6. The script will automatically process all images within the category folders, renaming them according to their category and a sequential number.
